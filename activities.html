                            <h3>University High School Marching Band</h3>
                            <p>All four years of my high school career, I was a member of the University High School marching band. I played Clarinet all four years and memorized hours of music. Not only did I have to memorize my own music, but also those who played around me so when we were marching we all had individual musical ques. The activities we did were physically demanding and we would practice daily over the summers for 8 or more hours a day. When school started, we would have practice 3 times a week for at least 5 hours a day, after school. With our dedication we won many awards and were almost always number 1 in our divisions at competitions. We would sweep out all the awards at multiple competitions throughout the years I was a part of the marching band. My Junior and Senior year, I was given the position of section leader where I was in charge of the clarinet section. I helped mentor and guide incoming Freshmen and new musicians. I taught them correct marching technique, tips in memorizing music, and to keep and adhere traditions passed down through generations of marchers. I always set an example for others through my leadership, morality, and good character. </p>

                            <h3>Thunder Drum And Bugle Corps</h3>
                            <p>I was fortunate enough to be able to be in the 2013 Thunder Drum and Bugle Corps tour. I was one of the front ensemble musicians, where I had multiple solos and played many different percussive instruments. Thunder is a professional drum corps where we toured more than 7 states. I was faced with fast paced, constantly changing situations where adaptation and flexibility was key. I learned new instruments in a short amount of time to a professional level. I, along with the other members in the front ensemble, learned how to organize equipment to efficiently store and transport it safely, in a timely manner, on semi-trucks, in arenas, on fields, and in practice areas. We were honored with being able to perform in the Denver Bronco’s Mile High stadium in Colorado in front of over 7000 people. Overall, this was an amazing experience which helped teach me many personal values and has shaped my leadership abilities beyond what I ever expected.</p>

                            <h3>The National Society of Leadership and Success</h3>
                            <p>I was nominated to be a member of The National Society of Leadership and Success, a national organization throughout many universities in the United States. NSLS is the largest leadership honor society in the nation with 500 chapters and currently has 582,664 members nationwide. As of now I am going through the steps to be inducted into the society by this June.  The society offers members scholarships, a job bank, help on resumes, recommendations from the society’s president, and much more. I hope to be the social event coordinator for our chapter at Eastern Washington University and become more involved with the society. I cannot wait for the experiences I will learn from and cherish being a part of this amazing society throughout my college career.</p>

                            <h3>Camp Journey</h3>
                            <p>I have been blessed to be a cancer survivor and not only attend, but have the chance to be a counselor at an amazing summer camp for cancer patients and survivors. I was a camper at Camp Journey, which used to be known as Camp Goodtimes, for more than ten years. I completed 2 years as an L.I.T, leader in training, where we learned how to be good camp counselors. We had the chance to help with cabin groups of children ages 6-13 for a few days during the week and learn hands on what it would be like to be a cabin counselor. During camp we participated in so many activities using leadership abilities, group coordination, and much more. I’ve made so many great, lifelong memories and many people who I consider family by being able to be a part of this amazing camp.</p>
