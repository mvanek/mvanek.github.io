    <p>My name is Mykel Raej Vanek. I was born in 1997 in Spokane Washington. I am currently a junior at Eastern Washington University and pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in communications with a focus in public relations, and also a minor in visual communications design.
        </p>
        <p>I would love to start a career after graduating in which I can help make a difference in people's lives. I want to be able to influence people in a positive way.
