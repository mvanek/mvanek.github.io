                         <p>My name is Mykel Raej Vanek. I was born in 1997 in Spokane, Washington. I am currently a junior at Eastern Washington University pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in communications with a focus in public relations, and also a minor in visual communications design. I was nominated for the National Society of Leadership and Success and will be inducted within the next year. </p>

                           <p>I would love to start a career after graduating in which I can help make a difference in people's lives. I want to be able to influence people in a positive way.
                                </p>

                        <h3 class="movea">Riverfront Park</h3>
                        
                        <p>I had the opportunity to work at Riverfront Park as a rides attendant the summer of 2015. I learned how to operate 14 rides, applying safety procedures at all times. I worked day in and day out with the public giving information about the park. I always used excellent customer service skills and received many compliments for my upbeat personality. I dealt with all ages, and the mentally handicapped.I handled unruly guests with ease and if there was a problem that I couldn’t handle on my own, I let my supervisor deal with what needed to be accomplished. I learned from this job that I love working with the public, face to face with people.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Ecology Youth Corps</h3>
                        
                        <p>The summer of 2012 I was selected out of 1,200 applicants, and later 500 interviewed, to be a litter crew member for the Department of Ecology through Ecology Youth Corps. My crew was designated to pick up litter along local Spokane freeways and recycle various materials. We learned and applied safety procedures to every day at the job, work in team coordinated activities, as well as individually. We dealt with all types of weather since we were outside all day. We once were invited to a state wide team coordination event where different litter crews from around the state got to compete in friendly competitions to see which crews were doing the best. Our team was among the best. I really enjoyed this job and found out I am capable of working by myself as well as in a team setting.</p>
                        
                        <h3>A.W.A.N.A Youth Group</h3>
                        
                        <p>In my home town of Valley Ford, my local church had an A.W.A.N.A Youth group chapter which I was lucky to be a part of. Not only was I a member for many years, I was allowed to be a youth leader for the youngest age group of A.W.A.N.A. I was in charge of a group of 5 to 10 children ages 4 through 9. I would teach them scripture and help them learn rules, games and to have fun. At the end of every night we would come together into a big group of 20+ children and I, individually and sometimes with the other volunteers, would be allowed to create and present a story for them.  I built many strong connections with these kids and loved every minute.</p>

                        <p>Also through the youth group organization, I was able to be a soccer coach for kids ages 4 through 13. This was a very fun experience where I could help teach these kids an enjoyable sport where I could see them grow in skill every day. </p>
