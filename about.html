 <p>My name is Mykel Raej Vanek. I was born in 1997 in Spokane, Washington. I am currently a junior at Eastern Washington University pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in communications with a focus in public relations, and also a minor in visual communications design. I was nominated for the National Society of Leadership and Success and will be inducted within the next year. </p>
       
   <p>I would love to start a career after graduating in which I can help make a difference in people's lives. I want to be able to influence people in a positive way.
