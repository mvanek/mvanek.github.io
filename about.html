 <p>My name is Mykel Raej Vanek. I was born in 1997 in Spokane, Washington. I am currently a junior at Eastern Washington University pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in communications with a focus in public relations, and also a minor in visual communications design. I was nominated for the National Society of Leadership and Success and will be inducted within the next year. </p>
       
   <p>I would love to start a career after graduating in which I can help make a difference in people's lives. I want to be able to influence people in a positive way.

    <h2>Experience</h2>        
            <p>I had the opportunity to work at River Front Park as a rides attendant the summer of 2015. I learned how to operate 14 rides, applying safety procedures at all times. I worked day in and day out with the public giving information about the park. I always used excellent customer service skills and received many compliments for my upbeat personality. I dealt with all ages, and the mentally handicapped.I handled unruly guests with ease and if there was a problem that I couldn’t handle on my own, I let my supervisor deal with what needed to be accomplished.I learned from this job that I love working with the public, face to face with people.</p>
